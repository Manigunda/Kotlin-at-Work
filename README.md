# Kotlin-at-Work
# Game of Life
The Conway’s game of life is a famous Cellular Automata devised by a British Mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The Universe of Game of life is an Infinite Two Dimentional Orthogonal Grid of square cells each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally vertically or diagonally adajacent.

# RULES TO FOLLOW:

Any live cell with fewer  than two neighbours dies, as it caused by underpopulation.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

Any live cells with more than three neighbours dies as it of overpopulation.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Many different types of patterns occur in the Game of Life, which are classified according to their behaviour. Common pattern types include still lifes , which do not change from one generation to the next oscillators, which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations, and spaceships, which translate themselves across the grid.

There are different types of models in the Patterns:

Still lifes: Block,Behave,Loaf,Boat,tub.

Oscillators: Blinker,Toad,Beacon,Pulsar,Pentadecathlon.

Spaceships: Glider,Leight weight spaceships(LWSS),Middle weight spaceships(MWSS), Heavy weight spaceships(HWSS).

One more pattern which waaas developed was Gosper glider gun pattern which was led Bill Gosper.it was the first glider in 15th generation.

All the above patterns workd according the rules.

I have developed the above patterns using Koltin programming language.

# kotlin:

Kotlin was announced in 2017 by Google I/O. Kotlin is designed to inter operate fully with Java, and the JVM(JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE) version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class.
In earlier we have java as a official programming language now we have Kotlin.

Kotlin is the programming language used to develop Android Applications. 

It is similar to Java when comes to Execution and features.

Kotlin v1.0 was released on 15 February 2016. This is considered to be the officially stable release and JetBrains has committed to long-term backwards compatibility starting with this version.

I have used koltin programming language different features to develop the above patterns.

IDE : Intellij

Build system: Gradle (It is used for building the project, testing in Intellij Ide)

Testcases: Junit

The complete project was developed by using Koltin features.
